## About

This website allows you to track your budget and purchases, online and offline.

## Description

On page load, you are able to see input areas for products and then choose to `Add funds` or `Subtract funds` from your budget. After you have inputted your item, you can see it load onto the page in the form of a graph which allows for the user to see their budget holistically.
